# Compiling
To compile this project you must have GameMaker Studio 1.x

# Third-party software
Code editor: [GMEdit](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gmedit)

I don't remember exactly, but I think I used "Particle Designer" or something like that for my particle system when score increases

# Keep in mind!
The source code is very old, full of various crutches and shit solutions, because it was written, when I was a 16 years old stupid "coder" :)
